# plc-code-analysis — reference catalogue

## Analysis passes

Each reference file represents one analysis pass. Claude loads them sequentially,
analyzes the code through that lens, summarizes findings, then moves to the next.

| Pass | Reference file | Role | Focus |
| ------ | --------------- | ------ | ------- |
| 1 | `references/process-architect.md` | Process Architect | Physical plausibility, process context, state-aware invariants, operational logic placement |
| 2 | `references/security-practices.md` | Security Auditor | Top 20 Secure PLC Coding Practices, input validation, register separation, communication hardening |
| 3 | `references/threat-mapping.md` | Threat Analyst | MITRE ATT&CK for ICS technique identification, adversarial pattern detection, evasion indicators |
| 4 | `references/compiler-critic.md` | Compiler Critic | Siemens platform-specific bugs, CWE memory safety, optimized access, safety program boundary |
| 5 | `references/hardware-reviewer.md` | Hardware Reviewer | CPU access settings, enabled services, protocol security, network exposure, protection levels |

## Pass order rationale

Process context **must** come first. Understanding what the code physically controls
(pump vs. indicator lamp, chemical reactor vs. conveyor belt) determines the severity
of every finding in subsequent passes. A missing bounds check is LOW on a display
variable but CRITICAL on a motor speed setpoint.

Security Practices and Threat Mapping are separated because they serve different
purposes: practices answer "does this code follow defensive coding standards?" while
threat mapping answers "does this code exhibit patterns associated with known attack
techniques?" A finding might violate no coding practice but still match a threat
technique pattern (e.g., unusual clock-based triggers).

Compiler Critic follows security passes because its findings are platform-specific —
they matter regardless of adversarial context. A V19 optimizer bug corrupts logic
whether or not an attacker is involved.

Hardware Reviewer runs last because it analyzes a different input (configuration, not
code) and may not always have data available.
