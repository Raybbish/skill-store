## Key Workflows

### Managing Local Sessions

1. Locate the `MultiuserService` on the Project.
2. Use `LocalSession` to interact with server projects.
3. Perform `Update()` to sync with the server.
4. `CheckIn()` changes to the server project.

### Multiuser Commissioning

1. Access `MultiuserCommissioningService` for commissioning tasks.
2. Manage asynchronous execution states.

## Enforcement

1. Always verify the `LocalSession` state before performing a `CheckIn`.
2. Use `AccessOptions` to handle conflicts during `Update`.
