# Knowledge Operations

Manage a multi-layered knowledge system for ingesting, organizing, syncing, vectorizing, and retrieving knowledge across multiple stores.

## Usage Template

**Prompt**
```text
Use knowledge-ops to organize this knowledge base. Deduplicate, classify, sync, and prepare semantic retrieval.
```

**Use Case**
- Scaling from a small wiki to a multi-layer knowledge system with search, memory, and vector storage.

**Expected Result**
- The agent proposes or runs organization, deduplication, vector sync, and retrieval steps.

**Output Example**
- A sync report listing indexed notes, duplicates, skipped files, merge candidates, and retrieval test queries.

**Verification Case**
- The output reports what was indexed, skipped, merged, or flagged for manual review.

**Verified Effect**
- A growing wiki becomes searchable, deduplicated, and ready for semantic retrieval.

## Success Metrics

- Report states files indexed, skipped, deduplicated, merged, or flagged for review.
- At least one retrieval test query demonstrates the organized knowledge can be found.
- No immutable source file is modified during organization.
- Duplicate sources, weak links, provenance debt, and stale metadata are separated into reviewable queues instead of silently merged or invented.
- Retrieval preserves the LLM Wiki pattern: Markdown source/concept pages are primary, vector search is optional acceleration.
- Agent/Wiki flywheel candidates are queued with evidence, target, and cheap verification rather than silently promoted.

## When to Use

- User wants to "save this to my knowledge base"
- Syncing knowledge across systems (wiki, memory, vector DB, git repos)
- Deduplicating or organizing existing knowledge
- User asks "what do I know about X?" (semantic search)
- User says "sync", "organize", "deduplicate", "vectorize"
- Knowledge base is growing beyond ~300 nodes and manual navigation is slowing down

## Knowledge Layers

Resolve wiki and system paths from `system/config.md` when available. If no config exists, default to `wiki/`, `sources/`, `maps/`, and `system/`.

### Layer 1: Active Execution Truth
- GitHub issues, PRs, Linear tasks — current operational state
- Rule: if it affects an active plan or release, put it here first

### Layer 2: Quick Access Memory
- Agent-specific memory files (e.g., `~/.claude/projects/*/memory/`)
- Markdown with frontmatter — user preferences, feedback, project context
- Automatically loaded at session start

### Layer 3: Durable Wiki
- Curated, interlinked wiki pages (concepts, entities, outputs)
- The canonical store for long-term knowledge
- Cross-referenced with `[[wikilinks]]`

### Layer 4: Vector Store (Optional RAG Support) ⭐
- **ChromaDB** (local, no API key needed) or any vector DB
- Enables **semantic search** across hundreds of nodes
- Embeddings generated locally via `sentence-transformers` (free)
- Automatic sync with wiki on every ingest

Karpathy-style rule: do not let vector search become the knowledge base. Use vectors to find pages; use Markdown to hold understanding, provenance, connections, and review queues.

### Layer 5: V6 Governance and Flywheel State
- `system/governance-dashboard.md`: latest health, daily-loop, and rule-candidate snapshots.
- `system/auto-update-report.md`: objective KPI scan output.
- `system/agent-wiki-flywheel-report.md`: recent agent/wiki signal scan.
- `system/system-evolution-backlog.md`: supervised system-rule candidates.
- `system/daily/YYYY-MM-DD-daily-knowledge-loop.md`: daily queue, KR, and evidence artifact.

These files may guide prioritization, but they are not source evidence by themselves. Promote from them only when linked durable sources or local checks support the rule.

## Vector Store Setup (Local, Free)

### Recommended Stack

| Component | Tool | Cost | Why |
|-----------|------|:----:|-----|
| Embeddings | `sentence-transformers` (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) | Free | Local, 384-dim, fast |
| Vector DB | ChromaDB | Free | Local, persistent, simple API |
| Sync Trigger | Watchdog (file monitoring) | Free | Auto-index on file change |

### Quick Start

```bash
pip install chromadb sentence-transformers watchdog
```

### Sync Script Structure

```python
# sync_wiki_to_vector.py — run on ingest or periodically

from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
import chromadb
import os, glob, hashlib

# Initialize
model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
client = chromadb.PersistentClient(path="./vector_store")
collection = client.get_or_create_collection("wiki")

def sync_wiki():
    wiki_dir = os.environ.get("WIKI_DIR", "wiki")
    files = glob.glob(os.path.join(wiki_dir, "**", "*.md"), recursive=True)
    for f in files:
        with open(f, "r") as fh:
            content = fh.read()
        doc_id = hashlib.sha256(f.encode()).hexdigest()[:16]
        # Check if already indexed (by hash)
        existing = collection.get(ids=[doc_id])
        if existing["ids"]:
            continue
        # Embed and store
        embedding = model.encode(content[:5000]).tolist()
        collection.add(
            documents=[content[:5000]],
            embeddings=[embedding],
            ids=[doc_id],
            metadatas=[{"path": f, "updated": os.path.getmtime(f)}]
        )

def semantic_search(query, k=5):
    q_embedding = model.encode(query).tolist()
    results = collection.query(query_embeddings=[q_embedding], n_results=k)
    return results
```

### Auto-Sync with Watchdog

```python
# auto_watch.py — runs in background
from watchdog.observers import Observer
from watchdog.events import FileSystemEventHandler

class WikiSyncHandler(FileSystemEventHandler):
    def on_modified(self, event):
        if event.src_path.endswith(".md"):
            sync_wiki()  # re-index changed file

observer = Observer()
observer.schedule(WikiSyncHandler(), path="./wiki", recursive=True)
observer.start()
```

## Ingestion Workflow

### 1. Classify
| Type | Primary Store | Secondary |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| Business decision | Memory (project) | Wiki decision log |
| Personal preference | Memory (user) | — |
| Reference info | Memory (reference) | Wiki concept page |
| Research output | Wiki outputs/ | Memory summary |
| Session knowledge | Session-learn extraction | Wiki concepts/entities |

### 2. Deduplicate
- Search existing knowledge before creating
- Check wiki concepts, entities, and memory for duplicates
- **Vector search** across knowledge base for semantic duplicates
- Treat duplicate clippings and secondary summaries as provenance variants: link them to the canonical source unless they add unique block refs or evidence.
- Do not merge primary filings, interviews, and local synthesis reports into one source; preserve evidence hierarchy.

### 3. Store
- Write to the appropriate layer
- If wiki page created/updated → **trigger vector sync** (auto or manual)
- Update summaries and indexes
- Cross-reference with `[[wikilinks]]`

### 4. Retrieve (Semantic Search)
When user asks "what do I know about X":
1. Start with exact filename / wikilink / `rg` search over Markdown.
2. Use ChromaDB or semantic search only when lexical search misses likely concepts.
3. Return matched wiki paths + relevance scores or match reasons.
4. Load top-3 files into context (respecting token budget).
5. Prefer compiled concept/entity pages over raw source notes unless provenance is disputed.

### 5. Verify
- Confirm stored knowledge can be retrieved
- Check that links resolve correctly
- Verify vector search returns relevant results
- Confirm P0/P1 wiki health remains clean after organization: no source-ref breaks, empty pages, or newly orphaned wiki nodes

## Review Queues

Use explicit queues for knowledge debt:

| Debt type | Queue action |
|---|---|
| Weak concept/entity link | decide create page, redirect, relabel, or ignore as example text |
| Duplicate source | choose canonical source and keep provenance note if useful |
| Missing source hash/source_id | recover original file/URL before filling |
| Single-source claim now has more evidence | upgrade evidence level only after source refs are attached |
| Fast-changing product/finance claim | schedule primary-source or current-doc verification |
| V5 structure debt | batch by MOC priority rather than rewriting the whole vault |
| Reusable agent workflow | extract to existing skill/SOP if it has objective, constraints, failure modes, verification, and write-back |
| Agent/Wiki flywheel candidate | promote only after repeated source support or local verification plus a cheap check |
| Daily loop queue item | complete one focused KR or P0/P1 repair; leave semantic rewrites supervised |

## AutoResearch Boundary

Allow autonomous knowledge improvement loops only when:

- the metric is objective, such as broken-source-ref count, orphan count, missing frontmatter count, or retrieval hit rate
- the check is cheap and repeatable
- sources remain immutable
- every auto-fix is reviewable in git or a lint report

If the target is interpretive quality, strategy, taste, or claim confidence, use a supervised review queue instead.

## V6 Operating Loop

Run knowledge operations as a bounded loop:

```text
Trigger -> scan state -> classify debt -> choose one smallest queue -> act or report -> verify -> write back
```

Allowed unattended:
- Count files, broken source refs, broken links, missing frontmatter, clipping queue, low-outbound pages, and stale metadata.
- Refresh dashboards, daily-loop automated blocks, reports, and review queues.
- Produce candidate rules from recent wiki signals.

Requires supervision:
- Mutating `sources/` body content.
- Merging, deleting, renaming, or inventing concept/entity pages.
- Upgrading evidence levels, trust levels, hashes, source IDs, or provenance.
- Promoting semantic rules into skills, schema, SOPs, or automations.
- Treating vendor demos, product launches, or single-source summaries as operational guarantees.

## Quality Gates

- [ ] Knowledge classified to correct layer
- [ ] No duplicates created (searched first + vector checked)
- [ ] Vector store in sync with wiki (auto or batch)
- [ ] Index/summary updated
- [ ] Cross-references added
- [ ] Verification: knowledge is retrievable (file + vector)
- [ ] Knowledge debt queued with clear next action
- [ ] Markdown-first retrieval path tested before vector-only retrieval
- [ ] V6 automation boundary respected: objective scans may run unattended; semantic writes and rule promotion are supervised
